### Introduction of Capital in the Twenty First Century

In the introduction, Piketty motivates his research of economic inequality, provides a survey of the field, and presents his major findings that he will illustrate throughout the rest of the book. What immediately struck me about Piketty's writing is that it is accessible academic writing without being condescending. Richard Feynman was a champion of stripping away jargon in order to define simply and clearly the terms that were being discussed, and I enjoy that Piketty seems to be from the same camp. It's amazing how most topics can go from being unapproachable to almost obvious when the terms are defined.

Piketty starts by lamenting the current state of affairs of academic economics research and discussion. He finds the field depends too heavily on theory, and less on analyzing the historical data. Part of the problem is the difficulty of collecting the data, which Piketty and his colelagues have done a tremendous job of.

I found the history of economic inequality theories to be fascinating. Piketty starts with [Thomas Robert Malthus](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Robert_Malthus) and [Arthur Young](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arthur_Young_(agriculturist)). I was passingly familiar with Malthus' apocalyptic theories of overpopulation, but Piketty provided a lot of more context around it. In the midst of a massive shift in production and booming population growth brought on by the Industrial Revolution, mixed with seeing his next door neighbors in France have their heads separated from their body with little ceremony, Malthus seems downright conservative in his predictions. Piketty makes it clear throughout his brief history that he isn't trying to prove that hindsight is, and still remains, 20/20, but that economic theory does not exist in a vacuum. The theories themselves are influenced by the times, and outcomes aren't rarely cut and dry. Luckily humans are pretty good about course-correcting, it can just take some pretty shitty conditions to get there.

Next Piketty talks about [David Ricardo](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Ricardo) and [Karl Marx](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karl_Marx). Ricardo was apparently obsessed with "The Principle of Scarcity", i.e., in a post industrial revolution world where the population was booming, and the supply of land was constant, the relative scarcity of land would cause landlords to reap ever greater shares of national wealth.

Marx, writing in a world where it was necessary to outlaw children under the age of 8 from working in mines, predicted some rather bleak outcomes. With capital mostly in the form of means of production, Marx saw no upper bound to what could be accumulated, what Piketty calls "The Principle of Infinite Accumulation," predicted a runaway train phenomenon. An ever increasing portion of national wealth would condense into ever fewer hands, and given their track record of treating their workers, would eventually lead to a worker revolution.

Again Piketty isn't yelling "Ha ha!" with a couple centuries of hindsight, but remarks on the tendency of the field to predict rather apocalyptic outcomes until this point.

Then along came [Simon Kuznets](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simon_Kuznets) who did some foundational work in gathering actual hard data w.r.t. economic equality. In 1953 Kuznets published his findings from studying income distribution from 1913-1948 in the United States. He found that the top decile's percentage of national income had fallen considerably from its peak, and decided hey, we've only been through two world wars and a great depression, time to make some generalizations. He proposed the idea of the Kuznets' Curve, where early on in indistruialized society's, income inequality rises as only a few are prepared to reap the benefits of the indistrualization, while as time goes on, more and more people benefit from the increased wealth of industrialization and income inequality goes down, like a bell curve.

What's great is that Kuznets himself warned against making generalizations about his findings, and only later came up with the Kuznets' Curve after the fact, even writing: "This is perhaps 5 percent empirical information and 95 percent speculation, some of it possibly tainted by wishful thinking" (Simon Kuznets, "Shares of Upper Income Groups", 24-246). Oh and what the hell, let's throw some cold war distortion field in there too, cause apparently he emphasized the importance of his theory to other economists, remarking the theory was important in order to maintain the underdeveloped countries "within the orbit of the free world." Take that Stalin!

Piketty isn't quite as unkind as I am, but he doesn't hold back revealing the facts. What's sad is that apparently the Kuznets' Curve has held real sway in the economic and political circles, despite, you know, being based on a 30-year period in a country which saw the largest stock market crash in recorded history, 1/4 of its inhabitants unemployed, and two generations shipped off to world wars.

Piketty points out that since the 1970s, inequality has risen sharply, and proposes that the question of wealth distribution return to the forefront of economic analysis. Piketty starts by putting forth his findings.

The big takeaway is that there are a whole slew of factors that contribute to either convergence or divergence of wealth distribution. The big ones for convergence are the diffusion of knowledge and the investment in training and skills that allow more and more people to pursure better paying careers. The main one for divergence is the simplified equation

    r > g

where **r** is the rate of return of capital and **g** is the growth of the economy as a whole. When r is greater than g, inherited wealth plays an increasing role in the economy, and income inequality grows. As long as you existing capital creates a bigger return than new wealth created in the economy, then existing capital's share of the economy will continue to get bigger and bigger. Also the fact that certain lucrative investment opportunities are really only feasible for wealth of a certain size compounds the inequality problem.

Piketty also states that Marx was right: there's no magical limit to the accumulation of wealth. This is what Piketty means when he takes about divergence, that since there's no limit, it's possible for inequality to continue to grow without bound.

Piketty backs up his claim of growing inequality in the U.S. with the following graphs: (1) Percentage of national income earned by the top decile, and (2) The ratio of national capital to national income, i.e., a good bellweather for the r to g ratio.

First to define some terms, **national income** is defined as:

    National Income = GDP - Capital Depreciation + Net Foreign Factor Income

where

- **GDP** = [Gross Domestic Product](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gross_domestic_product)
- **Capital Depreciation** = [Depreciation of capital](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Depreciation_(economics)), e.g., the cost to maintain factory machinery.
- **Net Foreign Factor Income** = Total income earned by the countries citizens and companies abroad less the total income earned by other countries' citizens and companies in that country. [Investopedia Definition](http://www.investopedia.com/terms/n/net-foreign-factor-income-nffi.asp)

Below is the graph of the top decile's percentage share of U.S. national income from 1910 to 2010. To read the chart, it says that in 1928, 49.3% of U.S. national income was earned by the top 10% of income earners.

We can see that from 1913-1948 we do see a rise in inequality, followed by a steep decline. The beginnings of Kuznets' Curve. Except since 1978 and onward, we've seen a continued trend of increased national income inequality, reaching previously unseens peaks since the 1920s.

Finally the graph below shows the ratio of national capital to national income in Europe.

{% include capital_income_ratio_europe_graph.html %}

The graph follows the same structure as the U.S. graph above, declining in the 30s and staying low through the 1970s, until it starts to trend upwards once again. Clearly inequality in terms of both income and capital with respect to labor has been steadily increasing from the 1970s, and it's unclear where it's headed.

Piketty has motivated the discussion, and prepares to begin.

### Introduction of Capital in the Twenty First Century

Thomas Piketty outlines his approach to the question of economic inequality in today's society that he will take for the rest of the book.

One aspect of economic inequality is income inequality, different from capital inequality, within a given country. To define income inequality within a country, it is necessary to have a notion of total income for a country; This is called **national income** and is defined as:

    National Income = GDP - Capital Depreciation + Net Foreign Factor Income

where

- **GDP** = [Gross Domestic Product](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gross_domestic_product)
- **Capital Depreciation** = [Depreciation of capital](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Depreciation_(economics)), e.g., the cost to maintain factory machinery.
- **Net Foreign Factor Income** = Total income earned by the countries citizens and companies abroad less the total income earned by other countries' citizens and companies in that country. [Investopedia Definition](http://www.investopedia.com/terms/n/net-foreign-factor-income-nffi.asp)

Piketty proposes a way to measure income inequality within a country by comparing the share of national income earned by the top decile, i.e., what percentage of national income did the top 10% of income earners earn. In a completely equal society, which we should note Piketty mentions as not a goal, we would expect the percentage to be 10%.

We can visualize this idea of income inequality with Piketty's data for the United States. Below is a graph of the top decile's percentage share of U.S. national income from 1910 to 2010. To read the chart, it says that in 1928, 49.3% of U.S. national income was earned by the top 10% of income earners.

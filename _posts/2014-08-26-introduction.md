### Introduction of Capital in the Twenty First Century

* Answers are imperfect/incomplete, but are informed by more complete historical data than any other analyses that rely too heavily on theory.
* History of economic inequality theory.
  * Malthus, Young, and the French Revolution
    * Question of how England would deal with explosive population growth during the Industrial Revolution. Arthur Young wrote on the poverty of the French countryside; France being the most populuous country in Europe at the time.
    * Malthus in 1798 publishes his "Essay on the Principle of Population" which demanded all welfare programs for the poor be stopped, lest overpopulation destroy the nation.
  * Ricardo: THe Principle of Scarcity
    * David Ricardo in his "Principles of Political Economy and Taxation" argued that based on the law of supply and demand and the growing relative scarcity of land, that landlords would have a greater and greater share of national wealth.
  * Marx: The Principle of Infinite Accumulation
    * Piketty outlines the conditions in which Marx wrote his "Capital" work. There was a need for laws to outlaw the employment of children under the age of 8 in mines. Marx saw a larger and larger share of wealth being accumulated in a very small population, with no limit to this accumulation, because, unlike in Ricardo's time, capital was primarily industrial (machinery, plants, etc.). Marx concluded that this would continue until an inevitable revolt of the working class.
    * Idea of Infinite Accumulation is still valid today, as it's unclear if there are any natural forces that put an upper bound on the accumulation of capital.
  * From Marx to Kuznets, or Apolcalypse to Fairy Tale
    *  Simon Kuznets theorized in 1955 that income inequality would automatically decrease in advanced phases of capitalist development, regardless of economic policy choices or other differences between countries, until eventually it stabilized at an acceptable level
    * Kuznets' theory was the first to rely on formidable statistical analysis
    * 1953 Kuznets's "Shares of Upper Income Groups in Income and Savings" which followed the US from 1913-1948. A poor time period to draw conclusions due to both the great depression and WWI and WWII. In fact Kuznets warned readers not to make hasty generalizations.
    * However in December 1954 at the Detroit meeting of the American Econonomic Association, of which he was President, he made his speech that would later be published as his theory in 1955, and gave rise to the "Kuznets' Curve"
    * Kuznets' Curve is the theory that inequality follows a bell curve, with inequality growing during the early stages of industrialization because only a small population is positioned to benefit from the new wealth industrialization brings (an early mover advantage). In advanced stages, as more and more of the population is able to partake of the fruits of economic growth, inequality decreases. Kuznets' himself admitted that this was wishful thinking: "This is perhaps 5 percent empirical information and 95 percent speculation, some of it possibly tainted by wishful thinking." See Kuznets, "Shares of Upper Income Groups", 24-246. Kuznets theory was also influenced by the Cold War, admitting that his theory was important in order to maintain the underdeveloped countries "within the orbit of the free world."
* Putting the Distributional Question Back at the Heart of Economic Analysis
** Economic inequality has been steadily growing since the 1970s and deserves to be studied rigorously ala Kuznets again.
* The Sources Used in This Book
  * Piketty outlines the sources used in the book
* The Major Results of This Study
  * There is no economic determinism, the history of the distribution of wealth is one marked by the influences of techonological advancement, social policy, geo-political events.
  * There are powerful mechanisms pushing toward converge and divergence of economic equality.
    * "There is no natural, spontaneous process to prevent destabilizing, inegalitarian forces from prevailing permanantly."
    * Convergence: Diffusion of knowledge, Investment in training and skills.
    * Divergence: r > g, i.e., the process of accumulation and concentration of wealth when growth is weak and the return on capital is high.
* The Fundamental Force for Divergence: r > g
  * r stands for the average annual rate of return on capital
  * g stands for the rate of growth of the economy
  * When r >> g then inerhited wealth grows faster than output and income, and leads to greater inequality in the form of inherited wealth. Other possible forces of divergence is that with larger sums of capital the rate of return may also increase, due to new avenues for investment.
  * Piketty points out that he does not theorize inevitable apocoalypse ala Marx, but the results are not heartening.
  * r > g is not the result of some market inefficiency or failure, but rather as the more perfect (in an economist sense) the capital market is, the more likely it is for r to be greater than g.
* The Geographical and Historical Boundaries of This Study
  * Only enough data for certain countries, mostly Western Europe, Japan, and the US.
* The Theoretical and Conceptual Framework
  * Piketty notes that he came of age during the Cold War, and witnessed the fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989. He is not a fan of Communism, and does not wish to decry capitalism, and even states that there must be some level of inequality for capitalism to function. However he thinks that the question of what the ideal distribution of inequality needs to be raised and should be studied thoroughly and attacked with a combination of economics, historical study, and the other social sciences.
* Outline of the Book
  * Part One: "Income and Capital". Introduces the terms and ideas used in the rest of the book.
  * Part Two: "The Dynamics of the Capital/Income Ratio". Exame the prospects for the long-run evolution o the capital/income ratio and the global division of national income between labor and capital in the twenty-first century.
  * Part Three: "The Structure of Inequality". Discusses the current level of inequality, analyzes the historical dynamics of these inequalities, studies the changing importance of inherited wealth over the long run, and the future prospects for the global distribution of wealth over the first deacdes of the twenty-first century.
  * Part Four: "Regulating Capital in the Twenty-First Century". Draws normative and policy lessons from the previous three parts.
  * Ends on a note that the title is somewhat presumptuous, and asks for the indulgence, promising to draw some modest historical lessons to offer the reader.


Thomas Piketty outlines his approach to the question of economic inequality in today's society that he will take for the rest of the book.

One aspect of economic inequality is income inequality, different from capital inequality, within a given country. To define income inequality within a country, it is necessary to have a notion of total income for a country; This is called **national income** and is defined as:

    National Income = GDP - Capital Depreciation + Net Foreign Factor Income

where

- **GDP** = [Gross Domestic Product](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gross_domestic_product)
- **Capital Depreciation** = [Depreciation of capital](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Depreciation_(economics)), e.g., the cost to maintain factory machinery.
- **Net Foreign Factor Income** = Total income earned by the countries citizens and companies abroad less the total income earned by other countries' citizens and companies in that country. [Investopedia Definition](http://www.investopedia.com/terms/n/net-foreign-factor-income-nffi.asp)

Piketty proposes measuring income inequality within a country by the share of national income earned by the top decile, i.e., what percentage of national income did the top 10% of income earners earn. In a completely equal society, which we should note Piketty mentions as not a goal, we would expect the percentage to be 10%.

We can visualize this idea of income inequality with Piketty's data for the United States. Below is a graph of the top decile's percentage share of U.S. national income from 1910 to 2010. To read the chart, it says that in 1928, 49.3% of U.S. national income was earned by the top 10% of income earners.
